## Options

> [!CAUTION]
> Some of the screenshots below may spoil some of the names of ARR Sightseeing Vistas and zones. You probably don't care
> if you're interested in this plugin, but everyone is different about spoilers, so I thought I'd let you know.

- **Show finished**: Shows vistas that you have already completed.
- **Show unavailable**: Shows vistas that have a time or weather requirement that is not currently met.
- **Show current zone only**: Only shows vistas that are in the zone you are currently in.
- **Add markers for ARR vistas**: Shows the visual marker for a vista for ARR vistas you have not completed, similar to the vistas in Heavensward onwards.

- Zone: Groups the vistas by zone, sorting them by number within each zone.

### Times

- Show time until available: Shows a countdown of the number of hours, minutes and seconds until the time window for a vista is open. Shows nothing for vistas that are always open, i.e. most post-ARR vistas, or for vistas that are currently open.

- Show time left: Shows a countdown of the number of hours, minutes and seconds until the time window for a vista closes. Shows nothing for vistas that are always open, i.e. most post-ARR vistas, or for vistas that are currently closed.
